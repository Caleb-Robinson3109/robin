# Robin

Robin is a **functional-first programming language** with a familiar **C/C++-style syntax** that makes functional programming more approachable â€” especially for developers coming from imperative backgrounds.  

Instead of relying on **monads** to handle side effects, Robin uses **explicit scopes** that broaden or restrict your abilities. This makes code clarity a priority, while still enforcing functional purity by default.

## âœ¨ Key Ideas

- **Functional by default** â€“ Pure functions are the baseline.  
- **Explicit scopes for side effects** â€“ Open a scope like `IO {}` to allow output, or `State {}` for mutation.  
- **Compile-time enforcement** â€“ Doing an effect in the wrong scope? Robin wonâ€™t compile.  
- **Familiar syntax** â€“ C/C++-style function definitions and block syntax for easier learning.  
- **Nested scopes** â€“ Scopes can be combined or nested for advanced effects.

## ðŸ“¦ Example

```robin
main -> int
{
    IO {
        output "Hello_World" ;
    }
    return 0 ;
}
